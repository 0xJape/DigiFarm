## 1.1 Background of the Study

Livestock farming is one of the cornerstones of every country and plays an important role in the agricultural sector. Livestock farming refers to the cultivation, breeding, raising, and management of animals such as cattle, pigs, goats, sheep, and poultry for food, labor, and other agricultural purposes. Aside from its economic significance, livestock also plays a significant role in ensuring food security, contributing to livelihood development, and sustaining rural communities (Kasetsart Journal, 2024). According to Joshua et al. (2023), the livestock sector in the Philippines contributes up to **18.23%** of total gross output value, emphasizing the crucial role of livestock farming in the country.

### Current Challenges

However, despite the economic contribution, livestock farming constantly encounters issues regarding data management and animal monitoring. Many farms, particularly small and medium-scale farms, still rely on the traditional and manual method of recordkeeping, such as handwritten logs and spreadsheets. These processes are usually prone to:

- **Human error**
- **Data loss**
- **Poor performance tracking**
- **Inaccurate animal records**

These limitations can result in:
- Missed vaccination schedules
- Poor tracking of health medication
- Decreased productivity and efficiency
- Higher incidents that risk animal well-being and consumer safety (Mwanga et al., 2020)

### The Need for Digital Solutions

To address these issues, there is an increasing demand for adopting digital and automated systems that can resolve issues of recording, organizing, and monitoring livestock information in real-time. Modern agricultural technologies include:

- **Internet of Things (IoT) sensors**
- **Global Positioning Systems (GPS)**
- **QR-codes**
- **Cloud-based management systems**
- **Drones**

According to Priya et al. (2024), digital livestock management systems enhance accuracy, ensure traceability, and simplify monitoring processes by integrating real-time data collection and automation. These breakthroughs aid farmers in making informed decisions and maintaining consistent records of activities and animal health (Kanagamalliga S et al., 2024).

### Philippine Context

In the context of the Philippines, the use of technological tools such as digital farm management systems remains limited. Many farms, especially in rural areas, struggle with digital adaptation due to:

- Limited access to information and communication technologies
- Unstable internet connectivity
- Financial constraints (Taer & Taer, 2025)

### Institutional Challenge

Institutions such as the College of Agriculture at Mindanao State University – General Santos City face the same issues. Activities such as:
- Tracking pregnancy cycles
- Administering vitamins and vaccination
- Recording livestock information

...are still managed manually. This creates inconsistencies and may lead to confusion in monitoring and record-keeping, making it more difficult for faculty and students to access real-time animal records during practical farm operations.

### Proposed Solution

This situation reveals that there is a need for practical and locally adaptable systems that can fill the gap between traditional farming and modern digital solutions.

**DigiFarm** proposes a web-based livestock information and management system platform designed specifically for the Animal Science Farm of College of Agriculture at MSU–GSC. The system aims to digitalize the process of recording, tracking, and managing livestock health data through an accessible and user-friendly interface.

#### Key Features:
- Input livestock eartags for immediate profile access
- Vaccination history tracking
- Medication records management
- Farm activity monitoring
- Dashboard for managing farm operations
- Overall activity monitoring interface

According to Panagiotis et al. (2021), transitioning from traditional to digital management rapidly increases management processes, minimizes problems in livestock farms, and promotes good practices for sustainable management activities.

- **Target Animals:** Cows, goats, and sheep
- **Location:** Animal Science Farm of the College of Agriculture, Mindanao State University – General Santos
- **Implementation Scale:** Small-scale setup for testing functionality, accuracy, and viability
- **Focus Areas:** Livestock research and management

### Limitations

#### Technology Constraints
- **No Advanced Hardware Integration:** RFID scanners, IoT sensors, and real-time tracking devices are excluded due to cost limitations and insufficient technical resources

- **Identification Risks:** Unclear, damaged, or unreadable eartags may affect accurate data encoding and tracking

#### System Dependencies
- **Internet Connectivity:** System performance relies on internet connectivity and server reliability
- **Network Disruptions:** Potential accessibility issues during network disruptions
- **Manual Data Entry:** Users must manually input livestock health information (weight, age, health data)
- **No Automatic Collection:** Device lacks capability for automatic data collection

#### Species Limitation
- **Specific Livestock Only:** System designed specifically for cattle, goats, and sheep only
